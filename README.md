# Rock_Paper_Scissors
A C++ console-based Rock–Paper–Scissors game built to practice procedural programming concepts, control flow, functions, and problem-solving.

# Rock Paper Scissors – C++ Procedural Programming

## 📌 Overview
This project is a console-based implementation of the classic **Rock–Paper–Scissors** game, developed in **C++** as part of my learning journey in **procedural programming**.

The main goal of this project is to strengthen core programming fundamentals such as control flow, functions, enums, structs, and logical decision-making.
